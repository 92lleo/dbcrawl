DBCrawl
===========

Crawler for db departures (http://m.bahn.de).

control/crawler: gets data using htmlunit (no longer updated)  
control/newcrawler: gets data using jsoup (better code & usable on android, too). not connected to the gui for now, just edit start and dest in source to test

Discontinued - newer versions are in lateAgain/control/crawler & crawler2 here > https://github.com/92lleo/LateAgain
